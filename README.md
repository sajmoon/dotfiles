# Dotfiles

## On Mac
Run `./install.sh` to install all basic needed applications and link configuration files.

This will use brew to install mac specific dependencies

## On other platforms

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)

We only need the config files, so link in dotfiles with rcup -d dotfiles
